This has two main benefits: first, they can integrate into a new environment together and reduce the risk of being bullied by an existing group; if integration fails, they can still rely on each other for companionship. Second, it significantly reduces the likelihood of single housing, which is fundamentally harmful. If you decide to adopt from us, please be fully aware of and accept this principle."
