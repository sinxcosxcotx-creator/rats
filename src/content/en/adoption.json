Here we showcase some rats from Ratopia who have already gone to their new homes, along with a few photo updates shared by their caretakers. Detailed adoption information will be published on our other social media platforms. If you are interested in adoption, please make sure you have read through our philosophy and educational materials first, then complete the adoption questionnaire (QR code provided on the side). The adoption agreement can be reviewed in advance. On mobile devices, please download the file and open it in a browser.",

This approach has two major benefits: first, they can integrate into a new environment together and avoid potential bullying from an existing group, and if the original group fails to accept them, they still have companions. Second, this greatly reduces the risk of single housing, which is fundamentally harmful to rats. If you decide to adopt from us, you must fully understand and accept this principle."
