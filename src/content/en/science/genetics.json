Some modifiers are written in parentheses next to gene symbols. For instance, research has suggested the existence of hooded-striping modifiers that can cause the same hooded genotype to range in appearance from Irish marking to fully hooded.

Such alleles may show a trait in heterozygotes, but if an embryo inherits one copy from each parent (becoming homozygous), it often cannot survive due to developmental defects—leading to embryonic resorption or death shortly after birth[18]. In fancy rats, the Pearl gene (symbol Pe) is a confirmed lethal allele: with one copy (Pe/pe), it can produce a pearl phenotype on an appropriate background, but with two copies (Pe/Pe), the embryo is not viable. Similarly, some marking genes (for example, Dalmatian spotting, downunder) have been reported as lethal when homozygous, potentially causing extreme depigmentation and neural crest development problems. In breeding, for genes suspected or known to be lethal, two carriers should not be paired to avoid producing non-viable embryos."

In experimental contexts, French scientists had already fixed the Hooded mutation in the late 19th century for genetic research, as a classic example of recessive inheritance. In the pet world, a rat club recorded Hooded markings in 1909. The hooded allele h causes depigmentation along both sides of the spine, producing a head “cap” and a dorsal stripe. It is also the foundation of many derived markings such as Irish and Berkshire. Notably, extreme “high white” hooded expression in laboratories produced an “aganglionosis” model, suggesting that excessive h/h expression together with other white-spotting genetics can trigger developmental defects."
