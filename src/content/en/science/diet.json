          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "A more realistic issue lies in production cost structures. Building a dedicated production line solely for fancy rats represents a massive investment. Meanwhile, overall awareness of animal welfare remains limited, and the number of keepers truly willing to invest long-term learning and money into rat nutrition is relatively small. Under such market conditions, few companies are willing to shoulder an investment that is almost guaranteed to lose money."
