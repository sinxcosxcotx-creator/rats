          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "A more practical issue lies in production economics. Building a dedicated production line for an exotic pet such as fancy rats requires substantial investment. Meanwhile, overall awareness of small-animal welfare remains limited, and the number of owners willing to invest long-term time and money into learning about rat nutrition is relatively small. In such a market environment, few companies are willing to take on what is almost guaranteed to be a loss."
