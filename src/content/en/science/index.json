Some content is整理、整合并翻译自 multiple sources including books, websites, ratteries, and organizations such as Pet Rat Care, Isamu Rat Care, RatGuide, the American Fancy Rat & Mouse Association, the National Fancy Rat Society, The New Scuttling Gourmet, Once Upon a Mischief, and Rat Variety Guide.\n\nDue to content integration and language adaptation, the final Chinese version also incorporates observations and perspectives drawn from my own experience and from various original sources. As a result, it is not always possible to precisely attribute individual passages within the text. Readers who wish to consult the original materials may find the corresponding source links listed at the end of each article.",
