    "subtitle": "Below is a curated set of science-based topics in multiple formats. Some sections are compiled and adapted from sources such as Pet Rat Care, Isamu Rat Care, RatGuide, American Fancy Rat & Mouse Association, National Fancy Rat Society, The New Scuttling Gourmet, Once upon a Mischief, Rat Variety Guide, and more. Because this project involves integration and language conversion, parts of the writing may also reference my own experience and content across different pages. The final Chinese draft is an integrated work, so it’s not always possible to mark every citation inside the text. If you need sources, you can check the original links listed at the end of each article where applicable.",
