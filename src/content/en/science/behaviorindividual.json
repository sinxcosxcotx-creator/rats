If you are familiar with their daily habits, expressions, and behavioral details, you can often sense something is wrong before symptoms become overt. Earlier detection and response can significantly affect resilience and recovery."

          "text": "The key is knowing each rat’s personal “normal.” Regularly observe their cage behavior and free-roam interactions to establish baselines. The signs listed below are common but not exhaustive. Individual differences are large, so trust your intuition—often when you feel something is off, it is. Gathering observations before a vet visit can help, as caretakers’ intuition is difficult to convey verbally."

Visually, aggressive puffing carries forward momentum like a tightly wound energy ball; illness-related puffing looks lethargic and subdued."

          "text": "Ill rats often groom less, worsening coat condition and making fluffing more pronounced. Piloerection also aids heat retention when body temperature is difficult to maintain. In cold weather, puffing alone doesn’t confirm illness—consider other signs. If the rat seems cold, provide warmth (heating pads, hand warmers, or hot water bottles protected from chewing). Companions and bedding also contribute significantly to warmth."

This may be stress-related (e.g., introductions or a recent move) or a disease sign, often alongside increased sneezing. If recent stress is likely and no other symptoms are present, close monitoring may be appropriate. Foods believed to support immunity (such as echinacea or garlic) may help. Medications are better reserved for confirmed illness to avoid reducing later effectiveness."
