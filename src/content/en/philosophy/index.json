Here, you can learn about Ratopia’s three primary principles as well as the accompanying Q&A section. These principles are not intended to suit every rattery or breeder. I maintain an attitude of seeking common ground while respecting differences, and welcome fellow breeders and adopters to discuss and reflect on the individual components of these ideas together.",

Husbandry focuses on space, enrichment, feeding, and stress management. Medical care emphasizes restraint under uncertainty and opposes excessive intervention. Breeding is grounded in record-keeping and risk control, and explicitly rejects extreme selective practices. The Q&A section addresses common points of controversy while clarifying boundaries and responsibilities. Together, these four components form a practical framework that is executable, reviewable, and open to evaluation."
