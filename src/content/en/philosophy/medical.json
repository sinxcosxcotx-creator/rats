For rodents like rats, medical care is not about “how much we can do”, but about minimizing additional harm caused by misguided intervention under conditions of high uncertainty.",

It is precisely under this premise that a medical philosophy becomes crucial—because it defines the attitude and boundaries humans should adopt when facing illness, aging, and irreversible outcomes."

          "text": "It should be clearly understood that within the current exotic-pet medical landscape, veterinarians with long-term, systematic diagnostic and treatment experience in rodents are extremely rare.\n\nAs a result, many recommendations inevitably rely on extrapolations from dog-and-cat medicine or on inferences drawn from limited case histories. This is not a personal failure of individual veterinarians; it is an objective limitation of the overall system.\n\nFor that reason, I put the following principles first: medical advice is not a certain conclusion; test results are not a definitive prognosis; and technical “feasibility” is not the same as “worth doing”.\n\nIn rodent medicine, over-trusting the technique itself is often more dangerous than admitting uncertainty. Medical decisions must treat “lack of experience” as a source of risk in its own right, rather than ignoring it.\n\n"

          "text": "Rats are small, metabolize quickly, and have a very narrow margin of tolerance. They are extremely sensitive to dosage, frequency, and side effects. Any pharmacological intervention is, at its core, using one risk to hedge against another.\n\nTherefore, I follow these medication principles:\n\nOnly consider medication when there is a clear indication; prioritize drugs with relatively well-defined ingredients and metabolic pathways; and do not initiate treatment simply because “it might be worth a try” or “it could help”.\n\nWithin this framework, I am especially conservative about the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and compound herbal formulas.\n\nEven in dogs and cats, TCM lacks a strict evidence-based system; in rodents, the uncertainty is amplified further: complex ingredients, difficulty in precise dosing, and a blurred boundary between therapeutic effect and toxicity. Any assumption that something is “gentle” or “tonic” can, in reality, translate into an uncontrollable risk.\n\nMy stance is therefore explicit:\n\nIn the absence of clear, rodent-specific evidence, I do not use TCM as a primary or adjunct treatment. TCM is considered only when all standard medical options available have failed to reverse the course of disease.\n\n"

          "text": "Within our medical philosophy, I take an extremely conservative stance on spaying/neutering in rats.\n\nI explicitly oppose spay/neuter in the following situations:\n\nSpaying/neutering for the purpose of mixed-sex housing; preventive spaying to reduce potential future disease risk (e.g., mammary tumors); spaying/neutering for convenience, easier management, or to satisfy human keeping preferences.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward:\n\nRats have very low tolerance for anesthesia and surgical stress, and spay/neuter is an irreversible, high-risk invasive intervention. Without sufficiently robust, reliable long-term rodent data, exchanging a certain risk for an uncertain potential benefit does not align with the principle of maximizing the animal’s welfare.\n\nAt present, the indications we recognize are:\n\nClear, persistent, hormone-driven aggression (HA) that cannot be mitigated by other means and has significantly threatened the safety and welfare of the individual or the group.\n\nDisease of the reproductive system where spay/neuter can meaningfully improve quality of life and clearly raise the animal’s day-to-day comfort.\n\n"
