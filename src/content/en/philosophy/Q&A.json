    "subtitle": "This page organizes the most common challenges and criticisms surrounding breeding, and presents Ratopia Rattery’s response framework. I do not avoid the inherent risks and power dynamics involved in breeding, nor do I accept one-line judgments that attempt to define all breeding as the same. The core of the discussion is not whether breeding exists, but whether there are verifiable boundaries, constraints, and long-term responsibility—and whether someone is willing to bear the consequences when choices are made.",

          "text": "The key issue is not whether breeding occurs, but whether it is conducted with animal welfare as its premise, and whether clear boundaries and constraints exist. If any use of reproductive capacity is defined as oppression, then nearly all forms of human–animal interaction would fall under condemnation, including scientific conservation, endangered species protection, and strictly regulated companion animal breeding. This stance can be ethically coherent, but it represents a radical anti-breeding position rather than a generally applicable judgment of real-world practices."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "A more rigorous formulation would be: people who truly love animals do not consume or exhaust their reproductive capacity without limits or constraints for human goals. Once breeding detaches from health, welfare, and long-term responsibility, it becomes exploitation. But not all breeding is, by definition, oppression. Drawing clear boundaries is more valuable than blanket denial."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "text": "I am deeply interested in the genetics of fancy rats—not only the genes that determine color and markings. I enjoy setting goals for myself and, through extensive work across many generations, watching my bloodlines gradually improve and approach my ideals.\n\nOf course, perfection does not exist. But every carefully considered pairing brings me a step closer to what I define as “better.” Seeing the quality of my rats improve generation by generation, with increasingly stable bloodlines, brings an incomparable sense of fulfillment. This is the driving force behind my commitment.\n\nI keep and breed fancy rats for myself, or rather, to become who I want to be.\n\nI do not breed to chase sales, satisfy market demand, or shorten adopters’ waiting time. As a result, those who wish to adopt from my rattery may sometimes need to wait before an opportunity becomes available.\n\nI refuse to place my rats with impulse keepers, and I refuse to provide rats intended as gifts.\n\nKeeping a rat is, without question, a commitment of at least two years. In this contract, the rat is the true primary party. Even if the rat is acquired for a child, the responsibility of care lies with the parents. In reality, most children lose interest in a new pet within weeks, and parents must recognize that once an animal is purchased or adopted, the duty of care belongs to them—not the child.\n\nTherefore, adoptions must be conducted by parents themselves, and adopters must be capable of providing detailed care and covering necessary veterinary expenses.\n\nI am aware that this stance will attract criticism, but I will not change it. This approach yields the most meaningful long-term feedback, giving me sufficient data and conditions to refine my breeding plans.\n\nYou may have specific preferences when adopting, and I support reasonable expectations for the companion who will accompany you. When these rats meet your expectations in terms of color, genetics, or appearance, it often means you will feel more responsible toward them. However, you must understand certain facts: many so-called “rare genes,” “rare markings,” or “rare colors” were first discovered worldwide in feeder rat populations. Whenever a new trait appears, demand surges—people say, “I want that new color.”\n\nUnfortunately, many individuals then label themselves as “home breeders” or “ethical breeders,” and once they obtain a new trait, they mass-produce and sell for profit. The result is large numbers of rats with health problems being bred indiscriminately. These traits spread without control, quality declines, and the health and temperament of the lines deteriorate rather than improve.\n\nChina’s fancy rat market once experienced a wave of megacolon cases, largely driven by the pursuit of special traits combined with the reckless expansion of such breeders. It was a tragedy produced by mutual reinforcement of demand and irresponsible supply, leading to irreversible losses.\n\nI will never allow a rat to leave my rattery if I have any doubt about its health or temperament. The purpose of this rattery is to improve the overall quality of fancy rats, not to indiscriminately produce more sick or aggressive individuals—regardless of whether their eventual fate is neglect, abandonment, or rescue by well-meaning keepers.\n\nMy bloodlines will inevitably encounter problems, and I am willing to address them. I am also committed to maintaining active communication with adopters, as their feedback is critically important to me."
