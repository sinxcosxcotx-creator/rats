Within the current environment of rat keeping and breeding, I am trying to establish a system that comes as close as possible to what I consider an “ideal state.” Based on continuous learning in genetics, husbandry systems, and animal welfare, I repeatedly adjust and refine my own breeding philosophy and methods, attempting to correct mistakes and recalibrate along the way within the existing community context. This may appear idealistic, but I still wish to test whether it is practically achievable."
